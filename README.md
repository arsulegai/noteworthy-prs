# NOTEWORTHY PRs

The tool will assist in getting the PRs curated for the weekly developer
newsletter sent by Hyperledger. The tool will print list of all PRs from
Hyperledger and Hyperledger Labs into a html file that were raised in
last `X` days. The number of days is configurable, current default is set
to be 7. Similarly, it will pull all the releases created in last `X` days.

Note that the tool expects user to set the GitHub personal access token
with the read access. This is to avoid GitHub from blocking the machine due
to frequent API calls. The tool makes use of
[go-github](https://github.com/google/go-github/) for pulling the data.

## Dependencies

Option GitHub personal access token with read access (this is required
in case of frequent API calls, default rate that GitHub allow is 60).

Set the following environment variable before running the tool

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR LONG PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN HERE>
```

The tool is written in Go version 1.15, you can also use the docker
container runtime engine to package and run it as a container.
Tool also comes with a `docker-compose` file to make it easy to run
the command with default configuration.

Tested `docker` and `docker-compose` versions

- Docker version 19.03.4
- docker-compose version 1.24.1

## Configuration

The tool can be configured to fetch the PRs from any organization via
the configuration as long as the input `GITHUB_TOKEN` has read access.
